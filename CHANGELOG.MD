# [1.0.0] (2021-12-07)


@react-native-firebase/admob has finally moved to [react-native-google-ads](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-google-ads) 🎉!
As AdMob isn't part anymore of [RNFB](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase), a lot of changes where necessary to extract it completely.
Therefore keep in mind to test everything thoroughly as it's the first release.

### Features

* **config:** Add your AdMob app id's (iOS/Android) to app.json and this package will take care of the required entries in your Info.plist & AndroidManifest.xml.
* **docs:** Improved documentation using the new [docs.page](https://docs.page/)
