# Mediation

AdMob Mediation is a feature lets you serve ads to your apps from multiple sources, including the AdMob Network and third-party ad sources, in one place. 
AdMob Mediation helps maximize your fill rate and increase your monetization by sending ad requests to multiple networks to verify you find the best 
available network to serve ads.

This guide walks you through configuring mediation using the `react-native-google-mobile-ads library`.

## Prerequisites 

- Choose networks ([Android](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/choose-networks)) | ([iOS](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/choose-networks)) for your mediation setup.
- Configure your network configurations in the adapter's UI.
- Set up your network's demand in the AdMob UI.

## Install mediation adapters

For the Google Mobile Ads SDK to communicate with third-party ad networks, you need to include a mediation adapter for each network in your app. Each
adapter must be integrated in the iOS and Android layer of your application.

## Install mediation adapters for Android

To add an adapter on Android, you need to modify your app-level Gradle file:

- Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file.

- In the dependencies section, add an implementation line for each third-party ad network you wish to integrate. You can find the latest version of each
adapter on Google's official documentation for the respective network.

- Sync your Gradle project to download the new dependencies.

## Install mediation adapters for iOS

To add an adapter on iOS, you need to modify your `Podfile`:

- Open the `ios/Podfile` file.

- In your main target section, add a pod line for each third-party ad network you wish to integrate. You can find the name of the pod at
Google's official documentation for the respective network. 

- After editing the Podfile, navigate to your ios directory in the terminal and run the pod installer:

  ```
  cd ios && pod install --repo-update
  ```

## Verify your setup with ad inspector

To verify your adapter are installed correctly, you can use ad inspector ([Android](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/ad-inspector) | [iOS](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/ad-inspector))
in your react native application. To open the ad inspector from your React Native application, see [Ad inspector](https://docs.page/invertase/react-native-google-mobile-ads/ad-inspector) in the
`react-native-google-mobile-ads` documentation.
