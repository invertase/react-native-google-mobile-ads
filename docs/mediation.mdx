# Mediation

AdMob Mediation is a feature lets you serve ads to your apps from multiple sources, including the AdMob Network and third-party ad sources, in one place. 
AdMob Mediation helps maximize your fill rate and increase your monetization by sending ad requests to multiple networks to verify you find the best 
available network to serve ads.

This guide walks you through configuring mediation using the `react-native-google-mobile-ads library`.

## Prerequisites 

- Choose networks ([Android](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/choose-networks)) | ([iOS](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/choose-networks)) for your mediation setup.
- Configure your network configurations in the adapter's UI.
- Set up your network's demand in the AdMob UI.

## Install mediation adapters

For the Google Mobile Ads SDK to communicate with third-party ad networks, you need to include a mediation adapter for each network in your app. Each
adapter must be integrated in the Android and iOS layer of your application.

## Install mediation adapters for Android

To add an adapter on Android, follow Google's official documentation for the respective network.

## Install mediation adapters for iOS

To add an adapter on iOS, follow Google's official documentation for the respective network. 

## Verify your setup with ad inspector

To verify your adapter are installed correctly, you can use ad inspector ([Android](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/ad-inspector) | [iOS](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/ad-inspector))
in your react native application. To open the ad inspector from your React Native application, see [Ad inspector](https://docs.page/invertase/react-native-google-mobile-ads/ad-inspector) in the
`react-native-google-mobile-ads` documentation.
